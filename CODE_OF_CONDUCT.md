*HPE Code of Conduct/Contribution Guide*

Conduct
-------
This is the official “hewlettpackard” organization on GitHub: https://github.com/hewlettpackard.

Whether you are a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you.

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all regardless of their background and the extent of their contributions.

Please avoid using nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all. Be kind and courteous.

Those who insult, demean or harass anyone will be excluded from interaction. In particular, behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups will not be tolerated.

We welcome discussion about creating a welcoming, safe and productive environment for the community. If you have any questions, feedback or concerns please let us know. (github@hpe.com).

Contributing
------------
You are invited to contribute new features, fixes, or updates, large or small; we are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as we can.

Before you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans with the targeted project/repo through a GitHub issue, especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on your design, and help you find out if someone else is working on the same thing.

* If you want to contribute design assets or style guide revisions, please open a GitHub pull request or open a GitHub issue against the particular project.
* If you want to raise an issue such as a defect or an enhancement request, please open a GitHub issue for the appropriate project. Please keep the following in mind:

    * Try to reduce your code to the bare minimum required to reproduce the issue.
    * If we can't reproduce the issue, we can't fix it. Please list the exact steps required to reproduce the issue.
    
Submitting Code Pull Requests
-----------------------------
We encourage and support contributions from the community. No fix is too small. We strive to process all pull requests as soon as possible and with constructive feedback. If your pull request is not accepted at first, please try again after addressing the feedback you received.

To make a pull request you will need a GitHub account. For help, see GitHub's documentation on forking and pull requests.

All pull requests with code should include tests that validate your change.
